CODE2040 API Challenge
======================

# Content

This repository contains the programs of the CODE2040 API Challenge.
They are all made in Python. I started the challenges on Wednesday, November 5th
and finished them Friday, November 7th, but I did them in my free time because I had a
Physics test, class, part time job and all that.

# About the stages

I liked them. I had never worked with JSON so at first it was hard.
The first challenge for me was being able to get my token(I'm serious here). I wasted a
lot of time trying to get my token!! But it was good because it served as training! so yeah,
I learned new things! I read about some new libraries that I hadn't worked with before and that was
cool as well. And the last stage gave me some trouble because I wasn't using the datetime library
,which by the way is awesome, and I was going to make a lot of things that this beautiful library
already offered me.

# Extra

Overall I liked the challenges. I learned new things and once again confirmed how useful is reading
the docs of things. I hope that my comments serve as a guide to the reader because that was the purpose.
And that's about it!
